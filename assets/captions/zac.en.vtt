00:00:02.564 --> 00:00:04.132
I’m a big believer in giving back,

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.494
it is something my parents instilled in me early on

00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:08.861
and I take pride in helping people as part of my career.

00:00:09.362 --> 00:00:13.115
After spending a few years at the Tax department in a private sector company,

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:17.016
I was ready to jump into the diverse opportunities EY has to offer.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.466
I was especially inspired by EY Ripples,

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:22.931
which gave me the chance to use my skills, knowledge and experience

00:00:23.132 --> 00:00:25.831
to help make a positive impact in the community where I work.

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:30.660
I worked with a local impact entrepreneur to help improve their finance function.

00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:33.271
It was amazing to see how my work made a difference

00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:35.015
– it ultimately helped the business to grow

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:38.543
and create new jobs for the underserved groups in the community.

00:00:39.044 --> 00:00:41.430
Leveraging on the experiences that I had gained from this project,

00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:43.864
I later had a chance to take on a mobility assignment

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:47.481
where I helped a client to implement technology to improve processes

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:52.576
and save time on a tax return preparation during a three month stint in Argentina.

00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:57.109
Now, without formal and informal training at EY,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.554
I don’t believe that I would have been able to grow in my career

00:00:59.655 --> 00:01:02.403
and at the same time impact those around me today.

00:01:02.904 --> 00:01:07.048
I want to further develop my skills in Global Compliance & Reporting services,

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:09.838
with the ultimate goal to become a Tax Account Leader.

00:01:10.339 --> 00:01:13.510
So, I’m pursuing a Robotic process automation badge,

00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:15.416
to provide me the insights

00:01:15.717 --> 00:01:20.068
to support my clients in embracing the benefits of emerging technologies

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:24.012
and ultimately serve as a true business advisor.

00:01:24.413 --> 00:01:28.617
I am really lucky to have found such a rewarding place to grow.
