00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.095
Staying in shape and being healthy is a huge part of who I am.

00:00:07.196 --> 00:00:10.484
One of the things that I love the most about working at EY

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.548
is that I can pursue career opportunities

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.840
that align with my interests and the skills I want to build.

00:00:17.841 --> 00:00:20.981
At EY, I am able to leverage flexibility

00:00:21.476 --> 00:00:24.619
so that I can work toward my professional goals

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.062
while also training for my upcoming triathlon.

00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:33.066
With my data analytics background in mind,

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:37.015
my counselor and I talked about my career aspirations.

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:41.960
Then, my counselor helped me find projects focused on

00:00:42.727 --> 00:00:44.595
improving healthcare processes

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:47.447
using learning machines and artificial intelligence

00:00:47.748 --> 00:00:50.016
- combining my skills and my passion.

00:00:51.613 --> 00:00:53.797
I am due to go on an engagement to Italy soon

00:00:53.998 --> 00:00:56.130
and I can’t wait to take the knowledge I have learned

00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:59.001
of the broader digital health space with me.

00:01:00.913 --> 00:01:06.131
You know, by using emerging technological solutions in the healthcare sector,

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.646
I feel a great sense of pride

00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:13.830
as I know that the right combination of human knowledge and smart algorithms

00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:19.577
could help reduce or eliminate chronical diseases.

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:26.685
I am excited about the difference I can make when I achieve my Data visualization badge,

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:32.512
as I will use these skills to create linkages and uncover patterns, trends and insights

00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:35.922
that will ultimately help improve the lives of many more patients

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:38.491
in the rapidly evolving health sector.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.730
I believe everyone deserves to live their “best life”;

00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:47.932
While working at EY I have gained the skills

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.564
and found the support and the flexibility

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:52.829
necessary to help me achieve vitality

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.650
and allow me to pursue what is important to me both personally and professionally.
