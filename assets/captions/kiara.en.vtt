00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:03.466
I have always been interested in charting my own course and growing up,

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:06.346
I lived in both India and the UK,

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:09.351
giving me two very different cultural experiences.

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:11.938
This has stuck with me throughout my career

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.112
and allows me to look at challenges from multiple perspectives

00:00:15.213 --> 00:00:18.283
and give me an appreciation of other's diversity of thought.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:21.334
Instead of my parents choosing my career path,

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:26.680
I decided to carve out my own educational path and later pursued a career at EY

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.473
where I have thrived being part of a diverse team

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:32.607
where we get to leverage our different perspectives to fuel innovation.

00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:36.430
I’ve never really been satisfied with what’s conventional,

00:00:36.531 --> 00:00:41.466
so at EY I decided to enroll on a year-long intensive analytics course.

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:43.648
Even though it disrupted my career path,

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.251
it also opened up the whole world of opportunities

00:00:46.352 --> 00:00:50.966
and now I’m now part-way into obtaining my platinum Data analytics badge.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:56.082
It’s also helped me to gain skills and embed these into the client work that I do,

00:00:56.183 --> 00:00:58.878
enabling me to provide clients with better insights,

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:03.020
and it’s also allowed me to help my counselee discover more about data analytics

00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.047
and now she’s inspired to work towards her own badge.

00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:08.491
It’s helped me identify my next goal:

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:11.895
setting up analytics platforms across EY.

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:14.168
This is what I prize the most;

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:18.428
inspiring others to see the value of data analytics for EY clients

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.101
and to help them and empower them to root this in the work they do.
