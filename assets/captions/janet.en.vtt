00:00:02.373 --> 00:00:06.397
I have an open and curious mindset

00:00:06.725 --> 00:00:08.717
and crave a challenge.

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.368
I think that’s why I embraced technology at an early age

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:18.031
when my parents introduced me to computer science and programming.

00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:25.269
These skills helped me establish my career within a technology role in Assurance services,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.732
and equipped me to make a valuable contribution to the organization

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:34.695
– empowering auditors to use technology tools in their daily work.

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:41.146
But I was hungry to learn and experience even more.

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:45.148
So I chose to progress my technology experience

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.359
and embarked on a 30-day secondment

00:00:48.606 --> 00:00:51.960
to work on the development of EY Helix,

00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:55.285
which is a global suite of data analytics.

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:59.474
Being part of the technology advancement

00:00:59.475 --> 00:01:04.139
that is such an integral part of EY audits across the globe

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.292
helped chart a new course for me

00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:11.209
and ultimately changed the trajectory of my career.

00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:18.442
Now several years later, I have a senior role on the Digital Audit Team.

00:01:19.517 --> 00:01:23.401
I focus on data capture and transformation,

00:01:23.653 --> 00:01:27.247
adding significant value to teams around the world by

00:01:27.448 --> 00:01:32.832
improving audit quality and providing clients with insights about their business.

00:01:33.433 --> 00:01:36.769
My career to date has consistently provided

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.794
exposure to leaders, mentors and sponsors who gave me visibility

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:43.696
and responsibility on key projects,

00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:47.825
and responsibility, and encouraged me to grow and never stop learning.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:52.397
I also became a mother

00:01:53.412 --> 00:02:01.236
– and because my team members at EY have encouraged me to embrace work flexibility,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.640
I’ve been present for all of my children’s milestones.

00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:12.429
At EY, I’m always developing myself through the variety of experiences I have.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.465
I’m able to work with colleagues and clients in different industry sectors

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:19.328
across the globe,

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:24.490
and this has helped me to better understand and adapt to cultural differences,

00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.229
which is integral to our success.

00:02:28.673 --> 00:02:34.809
My advice is to take advantage of all the opportunities that come your way,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.058
as you never know where they may take you!
