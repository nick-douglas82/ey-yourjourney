-- Use the "direction" property to position marker relative to the centre of the camera and 8 directions of a compass.
-- Use the "depth" property to set the depth from the camera. Default is 1. 0.5 moves marker closer. 1.5 moves it further away.
-- Use the "coordinates" property to translate the marker position relative to its local centre
